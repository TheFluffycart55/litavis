## Welcome to Litavis:

Whether your looking for an expansion for Granite, new ways to use falling blocks in your everyday life, or a brand new challenge that follows the theme of elemental forms, Litavis is the mod for you! 
Explore the Archaic Ruins, a brand new structure home to the all new Burrow. Experiment with Tripslate and the ability to fall only when hit by projectiles, or even dig holes into the earth and extend rope
downwards to explore caves easier. 

To get started, you can look through the Wiki at the link below for more information! The Discord can also be found [here](https://discord.gg/kFGptT9eqe) if you have any questions. Beyond these points, my best advice
is to play the mod for yourself and to experiment before looking too deep into the wiki
